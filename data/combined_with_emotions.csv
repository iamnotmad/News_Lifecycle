youtube,UgwZRc5YktCsR-oikkZ4AaABAg,@abby54,2025-06-12T10:26:43Z,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide, and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves, will be exalted. You shall not make for yourself an IMAGE in the form of anything, in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. YOU SHALL NOT BOW DOWN TO THEM OR WORSHIP THEM; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love, to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. ""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search. These are the teachings, the Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ, our God. REPENT and start doing what is right. The Kingdom of Heaven has come near. If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard, because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him. This, then, is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.' For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. A time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit, and in truth. In the New Heaven and the New Earth, only righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, our God, be with you all.",0,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f3r8T50Lwk&lc=UgwZRc5YktCsR-oikkZ4AaABAg,0.239,0.696,0.065,0.9993,0.11267605633802817,0.14084507042253522,0.30985915492957744,0.2112676056338028,0.11267605633802817,0.11267605633802817,joy

There's no recall option in such a last moment and it would have happened. It seems the speed of the flight was not enough which pulled it down from climbing and hit on the building. If it was a plane area in front without any building, most probably they would have survived some how I believe. The dust at the end of the takeoff seems either they were almost out of the runway edges or something had happened in between to bring that much dust/smoke from the engine side but even the airline authority says they haven't utilized the full length of the runway, flight records show that they have backtraced and utilized the full length of the runway. Definitely there had some issues with the thrust being offered by the engines to get the proper lift. If they had realized it from the very beginning of the runway, they had options to cancel the takeoff but they are helpless if it had reached the almost the end of the runway. Only option in front of them is to continue only where they can't take a turn in such scenarios😔😔",1,1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMT76ZQlmMM&lc=UgwVePf19AsId-8_hYV4AaABAg,0.064,0.9,0.036,0.3612,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,sadness

This riveting series delves into some of history's most catastrophic aviation accidents, providing in-depth investigations into how and why these tragedies occurred. Through a combination of expert analysis, compelling reenactments, and sometimes even survivor testimonies, the channel aims to uncover the crucial lessons learned from each incident, ultimately contributing to making air travel safer. Each episode on the channel meticulously reconstructs the sequence of events leading up to a disaster. This often involves utilizing computer-generated imagery (CGI), voice-actor readings of cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcripts, and interviews with crash investigators, retired pilots, and aviation experts. The channel not only recounts the events of the crash but also explores the rigorous investigative process that follows, highlighting the often complex chain of errors, mechanical failures, or human factors that contribute to such devastating outcomes. By presenting these detailed analyses, ""Mayday: Air Disaster"" serves as both a captivating true-crime style show and an educational resource for understanding aviation safety. *I fully recommend looking in to this if you are interested*",0,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTErU7M2nJY&lc=UgyvkCC9huce1IJU3Xh4AaABAg,0.082,0.722,0.196,-0.981,0.1,0.25,0.05,0.2,0.25,0.15,sadness

Guarini School of Business, has experienced an unfathomable loss, as her sister, along with her family of five, were among those aboard the Air India flight that tragically crashed on Thursday. On behalf of the entire Saint Peter’s community, I extend our heartfelt condolences to our student and her loved ones. We mourn alongside her and hold her in our thoughts and prayers during this profoundly difficult time. Guided by the Jesuit value of being men and women for and with others, we unite as a community in prayer, presence and support during this heartbreaking time. In that spirit,.................. director of the Center for Global Learning, and ................chair and director of the Data Science Institute, are working closely with our student to ensure she receives the care, support and resources she needs. I encourage any member of our community who may be affected by this tragedy to reach out for support through our counseling and campus ministry services. Together, let us stand in solidarity with those who are grieving and may we honor the memory of the lives lost.

India incident to be verified but it looks like a catastrophic electrical failure on rotation. Flight: AI-171 | Aircraft: Boeing 787-8 | Date: June 25, 2025 | Route: Ahmedabad (VAAH) → London Heathrow (EGLL) Crash Site: ~1.2 km from VAAH Runway 23, post-V1 and rotation Fatalities: 247 (243 onboard + 4 ground) Survivors: 0 onboard survivors (alternate to original), 3 injured on ground ⸻ 🛠️ AAIB Preliminary Report Highlights 1. Primary Cause – Electrical Power Transfer Interruption (PTI) During Rotation • During transition from ground to airborne electrical configuration, the aircraft experienced a cascading dual-engine FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) failure. • Root cause: Uncommanded bus transfer failure due to arcing in the main power relay box (PRB-A), traced to water ingress during pre-flight GPU disconnection in heavy rain. • This led to loss of electronic engine control at rotation, resulting in both GEnx engines rolling back to ground idle within 4–5 seconds. 2. Flight Data Record Timeline • +0:11 sec: Nose gear lifts off. • +0:13 sec: Sudden engine rollback begins. Thrust reduces from 92% N1 to <27% within 3 seconds. • +0:16 sec: Master caution + ENG FAIL L/R warnings.

Following release of footages of 9/11 from different angles, even one from the ISS, and knowing fully from the Air India Ahmedabad plane crash that a plane, or two, cannot break a tower, let alone demolish 6 other buildings they didn't even touch; I am all ears for Titanic conspiracies.

reddit,1lhjun5,Nervous-Chair4265,2025-06-22T09:25:59Z,"🌐 The Splinternet of Power: Technology, Identity, and the Unraveling Order **I. The Career Ladder Is Cracking** In offices from McKinsey to BT, AI isn’t just streamlining operations—it’s erasing the bottom rung. Entry-level jobs are evaporating before graduates can get a foothold. Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” is unfolding in real time, but without the promised renewal. Instead, we may be building a permanent cognitive underclass—ambitious, skilled, and structurally shut out. The future of work is efficient, yes—but also disturbingly narrow. **II. Identity in the Checkout Aisle** When Instant Pot and Lenox release “Trump-themed” home goods, we’re no longer just buying rice cookers—we’re buying into a tribe. In this hyperpolarized marketplace, Baudrillard’s “sign-value” becomes painfully real. The political now lives in the kitchenware aisle, turning consumption into declaration and commodity into ideology. **III. The AI Cold War and the Rise of the Splinternet** The fear that America could “lose AI” to China isn’t just about tech—it’s about values. A liberal-democratic AI and a techno-authoritarian AI represent diverging visions of digital modernity. The global web, once imagined as a unifying force, is fracturing into geopolitical and ideological blocs—a *splinternet* where code, ethics, and power collide. This isn’t just a tech race. It’s a contest over the shape of society itself. **IV. Markets of War, Markets of Fragility** At the Paris Air Show, drones dominate runways, not just skies. The ""$100 toy"" that can destroy a ""$100m plane"" symbolizes a flipped logic of conflict—cheap, fast, asymmetric. Defense is booming, but Boeing’s crash in Ahmedabad reveals commercial aviation’s fragility. What Eisenhower once called the “military-industrial complex” is now a bifurcated economy: stable profits in defense, turbulence in civil markets. **V. Diplomacy without Consensus** The G7 has become the “G6 versus Trump.” His refusal to sign joint statements, early exit, and unilateralism signal the decline of consensus-based leadership. Into the void step nations like the UAE—ideologically fluid, tactically sharp—pursuing “self-preservation diplomacy.” As multilateralism withers, what remains is a strategic free-for-all, rich in volatility but poor in trust. **VI. Strategic Autonomy and Militarized Modernity** Europe’s call for “strategic autonomy” sounds noble—but it risks accelerating a re-militarization of public life. As Macron and Scholz invest in defense to define European identity, Habermas’s fear comes to life: the social contract strained by the quiet siphoning of resources from welfare to warfare. **VII. The Human Condition, Algorithmically Framed** AI and drones compress time, space, and decision-making—Paul Virilio’s “dromology” now animates daily headlines. Heidegger warned that when technology ""enframes"" us, we become resources rather than beings. From PowerPoint automation to plushie propaganda (hello, Labubu), the algorithm touches everything—from the boardroom to the toy store, reshaping labor, emotion, and influence in its image. **The world of June 2025 is fractured, fluid, and fast. What we build on these shifting grounds will depend on how well we understand the forces already reshaping them.** [https://open.substack.com/pub/openaccessblogs/p/redefining-warfare-with-drones-navigating?r=56p6o5&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false](https://open.substack.com/pub/openaccessblogs/p/redefining-warfare-with-drones-navigating?r=56p6o5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false)",1,0,0,https://reddit.com/r/OpenAccessBlogs/comments/1lhjun5/the_splinternet_of_power_technology_identity_and/,0.068,0.815,0.118,-0.9838,0.32558139534883723,0.13953488372093023,0.06976744186046512,0.3023255813953488,0.11627906976744186,0.046511627906976744,anger

Day 3 of the 1st Test between India and [**England**](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/afghanistans-strong-batting-display-puts-england-under-pressure/) at Headingley unfolded with a mix of resilience and remembrance. England’s tailenders, notably Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, stitched together a brisk 54-run partnership that helped England cross the 450 mark and take an 11-run lead. Adding an emotional layer to the contest, both teams wore[ black armbands ](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/football-pioneer-from-australia-passes-away-at-age-87/)and observed a minute’s silence to honor David ‘Syd’ Lawrence, the former England pacer and trailblazing Black cricketer who passed away at 61 following a battle with motor neurone disease. # England Seize Momentum as Cricket Pays Tribute to David Lawrence [**India’s bowling performance** ](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/india-vs-new-zealand-icc-champions-trophy-2025-final-showdown/)came under harsh scrutiny, particularly in the post-lunch session when the second new ball was misused. Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna persisted with a short-ball tactic that backfired, allowing England’s lower order to score freely. The absence of Shardul Thakur from the attack, despite being picked for his all-round abilities, was glaring and raised selection questions. Young skipper Shubman Gill faced criticism for delayed tactical decisions, especially in not introducing Ravindra Jadeja earlier. With the pitch offering variable bounce, a spinner of Jadeja’s caliber might have curbed the scoring spree. When finally brought on, Jadeja bowled a maiden over, underscoring what might have been had he been deployed sooner. Chris Woakes, with a composed 38, emerged as the linchpin in extending England’s innings. His [partnerships down](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/ipl-faces-sponsorship-shake-up-as-govt-cracks-down-on-tobacco-alcohol-ads/) the order ensured England not only caught up with India’s total but nudged slightly ahead. Meanwhile, Carse’s quick-fire 22 was vital in keeping the momentum alive. The contrast in lower-order contributions between the two sides was stark—India lost seven wickets for 41 runs. [David Lawrence](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/canadian-dairy-industry-gets-8-5-million-boost-for-sustainability-and-quality-assurance/), the man honored on Day 3, played just five Tests for England but left an indelible mark. He was the first British-born Black player to represent England in Test cricket and served as Gloucestershire’s club president until his death. His career, curtailed by a tragic injury, was marked by perseverance and a lasting commitment to diversity in the game. As the sun set on an emotionally charged Day 3, England edged ahead both on the scoreboard and in spirit, leaving India needing a disciplined response in their second innings.

Of the passengers, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 were Britons, seven Portuguese, and one Canadian. The aircraft, which had been in service since 2014, issued a Mayday call before losing contact. This marks the first crash for the Dreamliner model since it began commercial flights in 2011. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed their condolences, and investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash.

reddit,1lkhkfh,highdef51,2025-06-25T21:06:32Z,"Air India Flight 171: Statistical Analysis of Unusual Patterns in First-Ever 787 Fatal Crash On June 12, 2025, Air India Flight 171 crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, marking the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. While investigations continue, several statistical anomalies and unusual patterns warrant examination. **Flight Route History** * The Ahmedabad-London Gatwick route operated successfully 520+ times since March 2023 * Zero previous incidents of this severity on this specific route * Boeing 787-8 aircraft had maintained clean safety record across global operations **Passenger of Interest** * Former Gujarat Chief Minister (2016-2021) confirmed aboard * Had recently been removed from position due to performance issues * Possessed knowledge of state-level operations during 5-year tenure * Previously faced regulatory penalties for market manipulation activities **Travel Booking Anomalies** * Passenger initially booked for May 19, 2025 * Rescheduled to June 5, 2025 * Final rebooking to June 12, 2025 (crash date) * Stated purpose: family reunion (daughter resident in London since 2015) * Direct flight option only existed since March 2023 **Technical Failure Patterns** * Total electrical power loss occurred shortly after takeoff * RAM Air Turbine automatically deployed (emergency power indicator) * Dual engine failure reported by flight crew via mayday call * Landing gear retraction process halted mid-cycle * Complete systems failure within 30 seconds of departure **Post-Incident Response** * Aviation authorities immediately ordered fleet-wide safety inspections * All physical evidence destroyed in post-crash fire * Investigation details remain restricted * Flight number permanently retired * Compensation processes expedited **Statistical Questions** * What are the odds of catastrophic failure on a route with 520+ successful operations? * How common is dual engine failure in modern commercial aviation? * What typically causes RAM Air Turbine deployment during takeoff phase? * Why would a passenger change travel dates multiple times? **Discussion Points** The convergence of these factors raises questions about whether this represents an extraordinary coincidence or requires further investigation. The complete destruction of evidence combined with the statistical improbability of the timing creates an unresolved pattern. What explanations might account for these anomalies? **Sources:** **Official Statements:** * [https://www.airindia.com/in/en/newsroom/press-release/Information-on-AI171-incident.html](https://www.airindia.com/in/en/newsroom/press-release/Information-on-AI171-incident.html) (Air India official updates) * [https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-air-india-flight-ai171](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-air-india-flight-ai171) (FAA statement) * [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/aaib-update-air-india-flight-ai171](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/aaib-update-air-india-flight-ai171) (UK AAIB investigation update) **News Coverage:** * [https://www.reuters.com/world/india/plane-crashes-indias-ahmedabad-airport-tv-channels-report-2025-06-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/plane-crashes-indias-ahmedabad-airport-tv-channels-report-2025-06-12/) (Reuters crash report) * [https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/india/air-india-plane-crash-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/india/air-india-plane-crash-intl) (CNN analysis) * [https://abcnews.go.com/International/air-india-plane-crash-investigation-underway-black-boxes/story?id=122809083](https://abcnews.go.com/International/air-india-plane-crash-investigation-underway-black-boxes/story?id=122809083) (ABC News investigation coverage) **Aviation Technical Sources:** * [https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-tracking-news/major-incident/air-india-171-crashes-shortly-after-take-off-from-ahmedabad/](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-tracking-news/major-incident/air-india-171-crashes-shortly-after-take-off-from-ahmedabad/) (FlightRadar24 technical analysis) * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air\_India\_Flight\_171](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_171) (Comprehensive incident details) **Route History:** * [https://deshgujarat.com/2023/03/28/air-india-launches-ahmedabad-london-gatwick-non-stop-flight-service/](https://deshgujarat.com/2023/03/28/air-india-launches-ahmedabad-london-gatwick-non-stop-flight-service/) (Route inauguration March 2023) **Investigation Updates:** * [https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/g-s1-72594/air-india-crash-investigation](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/g-s1-72594/air-india-crash-investigation) (NPR investigation coverage) These sources provide official statements, technical analysis, route history, and ongoing investigation details referenced in the analysis above.",5,0,0,https://reddit.com/r/Mysteries/comments/1lkhkfh/air_india_flight_171_statistical_analysis_of/,0.051,0.828,0.121,-0.9876,0.10416666666666667,0.25,0.08333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.14583333333333334,0.08333333333333333,fear

Big mistake. The flight was suddenly cancelled without a single message, email, or warning. Not even the courtesy to inform their passengers. It took me 5–6 frustrating attempts online just to confirm that the flight was actually cancelled—their system kept lagging or crashing. But the worst part? I called customer service THREE times, and every single time they disconnected the call without helping me. No answers, no accountability, no support. When I finally checked the refund section, it shows that the refund is “initiated”—but there’s just a dash (–) where the actual amount should be. No clarity, no details, nothing reassuring.

reddit,1loe54w,Unusual-Remove1820,2025-06-30T17:47:28Z,"The world lost a rare diamond on 23rd June 2025! A tribute to a loved one - straight from the heart! I'm writing this post for many reasons - primary reason is to pay tribute to a loved one whose life and death both taught me invaluable lessons. It was July of 2024, on a mid morning - I was bored and installed an app - where I thought I could just have a random conversation about a random topic with a random stranger. The app then connects me to a Telugu speaking girl in mid twenties - who was very well spoken. As I introduced my name and place, she was pleasantly surprised and so was I. The app allows you to decide if you want to continue the conversation with the stranger only IF they press a heart button, which she did - upon my asking if she wants to - of course. She told me her name, and I cracked a silly joke - to which she sent me the laughing emojis. Just couple of minutes into the conversation - I don't know why - I asked her to sing a song. Without much hesitation, she sang her favorite lines from the movie - Animal. She particularly told me certain words from those lines are very close to her heart - which did me make feel that either she was in love or in love. But my assumption was wrong. Then we continued chatting for a bit that day and moved on. The next day, I messaged her - then I get replies, sometimes instantly, sometimes with some delay - but replies were coming through. It was all about, where she is from, what she does, where she lives and some of those starter questions and answers. And then there was a lull period for two days, as she was travelling, but something in her voice and her replies made me pursue her. My attempts to keep the conversation and the connection live were successful. I should admit - I was not trying to impress her. I was trying to know here better. In the course of this process, she opened up. Then there was magic. She told me about her family and how she lost both her parents - as I heard those stories - my heart became heavier. But it was a nice feeling - quite a nice one actually. I would just listen to her. She goes on talking about her father. How he raised her, what kind of food he would make for her, how he takes her to the beach to buy ice cream, what he would do during holidays and some of the interactions she had with her father. It was an absolute pleasure to listen to her. This went for about 4 weeks, then I realized - I was getting habituated to her. We are all creatures of habit. Little did I know - that - I was losing control. But it felt nice. She would tell me how her day went by, things she saw on the way to office, ice cream she bought (she would an ice cream everyday - sometimes many). She also told me the donations she would make - she was an over achiever for her age. The salary she was making - was something - someone with 20 years would make in the IT industry. A few things I noticed in her in all my calls with her. She would address me as ""meeru"" and I would say ""nuvvu."" After a lot of persuasion, she would then address me by my name. In the first week or so, her replied would come in the evening, after she finishes work, but as time passed on, her replies would come through a bit more timely, many times in the day and sometimes instantly. I realized that both of us have developed a liking. In the sixth or seventh week of my journey with her - one day - it was September 5th, she travelled to the place where I live in for business. She was just four kilometers away. But -we did not and could not meet. My heart was longing to see her. Until that time - I didn't see her - neither did she. We only described of how we look - some physical attributes like skin tone, height, weight etc. That evening, I called her on the app and was casually talking. I asked her - what if - we stopped talking from tomorrow? She then said, ""I don't mind that - but just let me know before you do that and dont ghost me."" I was like "" oh really?"" - she was ""Yes. I have seen bigger problems in life, face a lot - so this too shall pass. I will wish you well and try to move on, I can handle things."" Not sure what happened to me, I started crying. I said to her ""I love you."" In few seconds, I could sense her voice trembled - there was some kind of shiver - no acknowledgement or denial, pure silence. To my surprise, she cried as well. I still do not understand, why both of us cried. After she was back to the hotel, she left a voice message - that she loves me too. Trust me or not - we never talked about love or romantic aspects. I did tell her about my past relationship which never materialized. Fast forward, we moved on to insta - use to chat everyday, every hour, keep each other posted. She then shares a pic of her. When I first saw her pic - the first thing that stood out to me was - she has a style. She knows how to dress. She knows how to do her hair. She knows how to color coordinate. Above all, she was really really beautiful. She was so elegant. She wore a simple chudidar - I have seen that pic many many times. Btw, I created insta only for her. I then send her a pic after a month or so. Don't know why, but she liked what she saw and kept on complimenting me so much that it made feel I was being flattered. Everytime, I sent her a pic, she would say ""bagunnavu"" and sometimes ""chala bagunnavu"" We developed a strong bond over the months. We planned to meet in August 2025. She booked tickets. Don't know what happened, she messaged me that she wanted to meet me in June 2025. We planned to meet last Thu and Fri, go out - buy her a lot of ice creams and show her around. But you know what - exactly one week ago - I learn about her death. She met with a road accident and had internal bleeding and passed away. A couple of mutual friends, shared this news - because - I lost contact with her. After 2:28 pm - I did not receive a message. When both her friends, messaged me like - 15 minutes apart, I sensed danger and learned about the accident and her death the next day morning - which was last Tuesday. I ran into the bathroom and cried inconsolably. I went to work, I cried on the way. I cried in the office. Then I went to see a therapist, thinking they will magically reduce my pain, I cried there for 1 hour non-stop. My eyes shrunk, turned red. I could not believe the reality. I was constantly denying - not accepting what I heard. Here is the heart of the post. A few things about her and what she taught me - which will live with me. 1. She was the kindest person. She donated at least 15 lakhs every year. Adopted a few kids. 2. She was the smartest, went to the top 3 college in India. 3. She is extremely beautiful. 4. Went through trauma after her dad's death. 5. Went through trauma another time, just in few months, when her wedding was called off due to false and baseless allegations 6. She lived in pain as her relatives did not care for her. They only wanted her money and her property 7. She would smile and greet people with a lot of respect and love. 8. She always had best intentions for others. 9. Has the best dressing sense. 10. Was very ambitious and was doing many courses. 11. She did not spend much on herself - when it comes to her needs - she was very economical. 12. She was a giver and not a taker. 13. She was 25, but overall showed maturity and wisdom of a 50 year old. What she taught me! 1. Respect everyone. Address the roadside vendor as also as ""meeru"" 2. Drink water. Sip frequently and not just gulp all of it at once. 3. Work hard and be truthful at work. 4. Donate when you can. 5. Take care of parents and other needy people. 6. Have a journal. 7. Be positive. 8. Keep the desk clean. 9. Don't place your legs on the study table or dinning table. 10. Biggest lesson - forgive others and give time to see change. Guys, there are many details - I could not include. My heart is still heavy. I cannot cry any more. I'm not even able to cry. I could not even attend her rituals - as I don't know which part of the village her rituals have taken place, contacts I had was of no use - I did not get timely replies - I do not have their phone numbers. I kept calling - but they did not answer, as this news broke them badly as well. Life is really uncertain, she and I - talked about the ahmedabad plane crash and agreed that life is short and we don't know when death meets us. What made cry, the most, is she was calling out my name many times - none of their family members know - who I was. She was asking them to take her to me just before a few minutes prior to her death. They had no idea, what to do, but to listen to her. I lost her. I don't receive her messages, calls and voice notes. I miss her energy. I miss her love. I miss her badly. I dont know why God is cruel to us and even more cruel to her. She did not even get the right kind of treatment after her death. I don't know how her rituals have been completed. No pics. No videos. Nothing. Suddenly, there is silence. It is stupid to imagine that she reads this post but I wish she does. I wish she knows how much I miss her. I loved her deeply. So does she. It was pure and clean emotions. She was the best girl I met. She was the truest and purest form of love. Her energy was contagious and real. I miss all of that! We could never see each other, not even a video call - as she did not like video calling. That is life my friends. So my ask of you - is please do what is necessary or what your heart wants. My greatest regret is that I could not persuade her to meet me a bit earlier. She told me that she will bake a banana cake for me. She told that she will teach me how to roll the sleeves. She told me that she wanted to hold my hands. She told me that she would like me to get flowers for her and she would keep them forever. She told that she was over excited. She told me that she could not sleep. She told me that only 54 hours left to meet me and in 2 hours I lost her. Everything reminds me of you. I listen to your funny voice notes. I listen to the songs you sung for me. I listen to the stories you told me. I read the messages you sent me. Nothing can undo the reality. I started to come to terms with this new normal. I'm grieving. I will grieve as long as I should. I love you! I miss you papa! You will live through me. Edit# 1: Last month, about this time, I was not sure how brutal was the accident and whether you survived or not. These were the most painful days of my life! I don’t know how I lived through these days and managed to get work done. I barely survived! You didn’t deserved this type of end and at this point in your life. Neither did we. Papa, nothing can bring you back to us. I keep reading your messages and listening to your voice notes. And recalling the instances and moments we shared virtually over the phone. Thousands of thoughts run through my mind. I keep running away from them, but they chase me and remind me you are longer alive. This is so hurtful. But so is grief! It waits for you patiently. It is harsh. It is rude. It is indifferent. It is timeless. It is stronger than me. But somewhere I know, I will build the capacity to internalize your passage! And come to terms with it fully. I keep switching from denial to bargaining back and forth. I keep rationalizing. My mind is tired. But I will get through this. They all say, “ Rest in peace.” You really needed peace, that is constant and everlasting. I hope you found it. That is all I can and want to believe. Yours, eternally. My dear soul mate. Love you.",2,6,0,https://reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1loe54w/the_world_lost_a_rare_diamond_on_23rd_june_2025_a/,0.137,0.764,0.099,0.9988,0.10695187165775401,0.2192513368983957,0.24064171122994651,0.20855614973262032,0.13368983957219252,0.09090909090909091,joy

reddit,1loo5y5,raytoei,2025-07-01T00:39:34Z,"Article: Flight AI 171: Indian Authorities Reportedly At Odds With US, UK & France Over Crash Investigation https://simpleflying.com/indian-authorities-at-odds-us-uk-france-crash-investigation/ By Vyte Klisauskaite 11 hours ago Western aviation regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have reportedly raised concerns about the transparency of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash investigation being led by Indian authorities. According to two sources familiar with the matter, who spoke to Corriere della Sera, there are behind-the-scenes fears that local political pressures could influence the investigation and its final report. The concerns arose following the handling of the two black boxes, which were not sent to the United States or France, despite both countries' recognized expertise in this area. Adding to this was the recent rejection of ICAO observers from participating in the investigation. Concerns Over Black Box Handling According to Corriere, the primary concern expressed by Western authorities was the way the black boxes were handled. Western sources point out that the labs in India are brand new, having only opened on April 9, 2025. What stands out, however, is India's decision to extract the black box data locally, rather than sending it to more experienced facilities in France or the US, as is usually done. France recommended its BEA lab, but the proposal was rejected by Indian authorities, as per the report. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) were recovered on separate days, one from the rooftop of a building at the crash site on June 13, 2025, and the other from the debris on June 16, 2025, India’s civil aviation ministry announced in a statement on June 26, 2025. Indian investigators have begun analyzing data from the two black boxes recently recovered from the crash site near the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital complex, where the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed minutes after takeoff. The effort is being led by India’s AAIB, with support from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Adding to the concern is that India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) operates under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, raising questions about its independence, according to Corriere. India Reportedly Blocks ICAO Observer From Assisting In The Probe India has blocked an ICAO observer from assisting in the probe of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crash, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on June 27, 2025. In an unusual move, the UN aviation agency offered the assistance of one of its investigators for the crash investigation. According to Reuters, this is the first time ICAO has requested to be directly involved in an investigation. The last time ICAO investigators assisted in air accident investigations was during cases like the downing of a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-300ER in 2014 and a Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737 in 2020, but in those accidents, the agency was formally invited to assist. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the probe into the world's deadliest aviation disaster in a decade. Other authorities helping with the investigation include the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the United Kingdom’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which has the “expert” status in the Indian safety investigation. In accordance with international protocols, release of information on the air crash probe rests solely with the Indian authorities.",1,1,0,https://reddit.com/r/u_raytoei/comments/1loo5y5/article_flight_ai_171_indian_authorities/,0.056,0.845,0.099,-0.9819,0.05263157894736842,0.34210526315789475,0.05263157894736842,0.23684210526315788,0.23684210526315788,0.07894736842105263,sadness

reddit,1lqjhih,Skarky_Shan,2025-07-03T07:30:04Z,"Dark Humour and 'no intentions' logic ! I may sound woke or boomer, but give it a read. (Long and may sound preachy) Jk said SUICIDE JOKES ARE DIFFERENT BUT SUICIDE IS NOT A JOKE. Yes , suicide is never a thing to be made fun of but I have an issue with saying suicide jokes, 9/11 jokes , gender based jokes are okay until there is no intention...(The following is also to the ""dark humor ah joke ah paarunga"" insta pages) Look, jst bcoz u mean no harm with a joke doesn’t mean no harm happens. Suicide jokes might feel like dark humor to u, but if a person is actually battling suicidal thoughts, hearing ppl joke abt it can be brutal. makes em feel alone, unseen or like u’re mocking their pain, even if u don’t intend tht...even I have thought why do ppl randomly use suicidal jokes jus for the sake of it. Same goes for stuff like 9/11 jokes. Ppl say ‘there’s no intention behind it,.. its jus a meme’ bt these jokes still trivialize a tragedy whre thousands died nd they can hit hard for people who lost family or still carry d trauma. WILL WE MAKE JOKES ON AHMEDABAD FLIGHT CRASH OR A TERRORIST ATTACK just for cheap laughter? If these are sensitive then 9/11 is also sensitive. Just bcoz we didn't see it happening in front of us doesn't make that any less tragic. At some point, u hv to realize humor isnt in a vacuum. Ppl live through real sh*t nd jokes abt those things can trigger em,...no matter hw long ago d event was or how edgy u think u’re bein ... I also don't mean u can never do dark humor.❗ Bt ppl shld at least think abt d impact of it, not just ur intention⚠️Sometimes the line btw dark humor nd straightup bein insensitive is thin.. Are we reducing the social stigma or trivialising things? Jk himself says his frnd who struggles wid suicidal thoughts was literally triggered by BM's actions ...Will he not be affected by seeing ppl (evn his frnd) make suicidal jokes saying they have no intentions behind it....? EOD,, a joke can still cause harm even if u didn’t mean it to nd we shouldn’t hide behind ‘it’s just a joke with no intention’ when people are genuinely hurting... idea tht sth is “just a joke” bcoz it is not directed at an individual does not erase its potential social harm....!

reddit,1lqmtr5,Trick_squirrelhaha,2025-07-03T11:08:17Z,"💸 How Much Money Has Sundar Taken From Jethalal? I Sat Down and Calculated Every Paisa ofc with the help.of chatgpt (God Help Me) Okay, this post is long overdue — both for this subreddit and for Jethalal’s sanity. I’ve been watching Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah since I was a kid, and over the years one thing has remained constant: Sundarlal comes to Mumbai, causes chaos, and Jethalal pays. Every. Single. Time. So I finally sat down with a notepad, a calculator, old episode clips, some chai… and a lot of regret — and I calculated how much money Sundar has ""borrowed"" from Jethalal over the years. I'm not talking vague guesses — I broke it down line by line. 1. ✈️ Flight Tickets (Ahmedabad ⇄ Mumbai) Sundar doesn’t just come alone. He brings a baraat of friends, and somehow Jetha always ends up paying for everyone. Avg round-trip flight per person: ₹5,000 Usually 3 people (Sundar + 2 freeloaders) Approx 25 visits in the show's timeline Total: ₹5,000 × 3 × 25 = ₹3,75,000 2. 🏨 Hotel/Stay Costs Sometimes they stay in hotels, sometimes they turn Gada Electronics into a crash pad. Either way, Jethalal’s wallet cries. 2 rooms × ₹3,000 per night × 2 nights per visit × 25 visits = ₹3,00,000 3. 🚕 Taxi/Uber Reimbursements Classic Sundar line: “Jethaji, 5,000 rupaye de do — airport se Gokuldham ka taxi bhada hua.” Bro... is he booking a helicopter? ₹5,000 × 25 trips = ₹1,25,000 4. 🍛 Gokuldham Party Costs Every time Sundar is in town, he throws a party. But the bill? Guess who. Jethalal feeds the entire society on Sundar’s behalf. Roughly 10 events × ₹10,000 = ₹1,00,000 5. 🚆 Jethalal's Visits to Ahmedabad Yup, Jethalal also had to go to Ahmedabad thanks to Sundar’s emotional blackmail. (Remember the time he had to sign some urgent paper and Daya guilt-tripped him?) ₹6,000 per trip × 6 trips = ₹36,000 6. 📦 Freight/Courier Scams Sundar once sent sweets and claimed the courier cost more than the sweets themselves. And don’t forget the fake ""goods delivery"" charges. Let's say ₹25,000 per scam × 4 incidents = ₹1,00,000 7. 🧾 Confirmed Major ""Loans""/Demands from Episodes These are legit numbers pulled from actual episodes and media coverage: 📅 Incident 💵 Amount Ep 2211 – Clothes funding ₹2,00,000 Sanitizer business seed fund ₹50,000 Silver coin ""gift"" repayment ₹90,000 Demonetization cash exchange ₹3,50,000 ₹15k cheque twist (2025 episode preview) ₹15,000 Subtotal: ₹7,05,000 🧮 Grand Total So Far Expense Type Amount Flights ₹3,75,000 Hotel/Stay ₹3,00,000 Taxi/Uber ₹1,25,000 Gokuldham Food ₹1,00,000 Ahmedabad Trips (Jetha) ₹36,000 Freight/Courier ₹1,00,000 Confirmed Loans/Scams ₹7,05,000 🔻 TOTAL ₹17,41,000 🫠 🤯 And This Is the Conservative Estimate This doesn’t include: Emotional trauma surcharge Therapy bills Jethalal might secretly be paying Unseen offscreen scams Interest accrued since 2008 Daya’s impulsive “haan bhai Sundar!” approvals Some Reddit threads and fan estimates put it at ₹50 lakh–1 crore, if you include everything plus inflation. 🫠 So Why Did I Do This? Because someone had to. Because Jethalal deserves justice. Because Sundar’s ""Jethaji!"" gives me financial anxiety. If you've spotted more hidden scams, drop them below and I’ll update the list. Maybe we should create a Sundar Scam Tracker Sheet and send it to Mehtasahab himself.

reddit,1lqqll6,Appropriate_Regret_9,2025-07-03T14:11:33Z,"Don’t let Ahmedabad become the next Bangalore or Mumbai in terms of language issue. Just needed to share something that happened last night in our society in Ahmedabad. It’s bothering me a lot. So there are two friends or brothers(i presume as one refers to the other as bhai )living here . one from Delhi and the other from Maharashtra. They moved here about 2 years ago and honestly, I’ve never met more grounded people. The elder one runs his thing and employ some local Gujarati people , treats them like family. I’ve seen him speak to them with so much respect, even their kids come running to him sometimes like he’s one of their own. They help out in small ways too ,when our common domestic help is running late,they tell her to get home and do the dishes themselves. No ego, no noise. As they live in the adjacebnt flat I’ve also noticed them tipping Uber drivers regularly, usually rounding off to the next ₹100 and drivers leaving with a smile. Just good people. One of them donated blood during the recent plane crash and volunteered with the group managing traffic after that. So last night around 11 PM, I was on a call near the front of our society and saw an auto pull up. There was some shouting. I went closer and saw the elder brother being shoved by the auto driver, who looked drunk. He had grabbed his collar and was abusing him loudly. The brother was calm, didn’t retaliate, just tried to handle it peacefully. Then the younger brother came running down, saw the auto driver had grabbed him, and obviously got angry. He stepped in and separated them, and both kind of held each other off while me and the elder one tried to calm things down. The crowd gathered, 10-12 people from our society. The driver started shouting in Gujarati, saying the passenger (the elder brother) was refusing to pay. The brother calmly said “listen to him first, then hear my side, then we can call police if needed.” But no one was ready to listen to him or his brother. Just because they weren’t speaking Gujarati. The crowd just pushed them to settle the issue by paying whatever the driver was asking. They didn’t want a bigger scene, so they gave him the money - around ₹700. Later I found out he was coming back from the airport, around 11 km from here. Like usual, he walked to the main circle where rides are cheaper, and an auto driver said “meter pe chalayenge,” should be around ₹300. But when they reached, the driver showed some shady app set to “cab mode” that showed ₹708, and added fake night charges which he claimed is 2x and toll even when he took the auto from outside the airport. Total scam. I’ve taken that route myself multiple times at night it’s never above ₹300-₹370, max ₹400with proper cab apps. But the worst part? No one stood by them. The whole crowd just listened to the driver because he spoke Gujarati. The brothers weren’t even allowed to explain properly. That’s what hurt. Ahmedabad is a beautiful place. But this kind of language bias isn’t it. But if we start behaving like some cities where “outsiders” are always wrong just because they don’t speak the local language, we’re going down the same path as Bangaloreor Mumbai in the worst way. Not everything should be about language . Sometimes you need to see the kind of human someone is. Been here simce 4 yrs and used to admire how welcoming the place is Let’s not let Ahmedabad lose that.",102,35,0,https://reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/comments/1lqqll6/dont_let_ahmedabad_become_the_next_bangalore_or/,0.083,0.838,0.079,-0.6507,0.1891891891891892,0.16216216216216217,0.2972972972972973,0.16216216216216217,0.13513513513513514,0.05405405405405406,joy

Boeing has not commented on the expected timing. Current investigations are focusing on potential malfunctions in the engine fuel switches, which may have cut power to both engines. If confirmed, this points to a mechanical failure rather than a design flaw, according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. Despite the incident, Boeing shares have remained resilient. After dipping to $195.28 post-crash, the stock rebounded and reached a 52-week high of $230.20 on Wednesday. As of Friday morning, shares were up around 6% since the accident, trading at $226.81—outperforming the broader market, with the S&P 500 and Dow down 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. The aircraft involved was a 12-year-old Boeing 787 with over 41,700 flight hours across 7,800 flights. It underwent a full “C check” inspection in 2023 and had its engines overhauled earlier this year, following standard procedures.",1,0,0,https://reddit.com/r/GreenPipsTrading/comments/1lxbdwq/boeing_stock_impact/,0.038,0.891,0.071,-0.8402,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.2727272727272727,0.09090909090909091,sadness

reddit,1lxm14i,LeftLeaningEqualist,2025-07-11T23:44:15Z,"Details of preliminary report of Ahmedabad Flight 171 crash Investigators looking into the tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171 have revealed that both engines shut down within seconds after takeoff, leading to a catastrophic loss of power and lives. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, flying from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, crashed less than a minute after takeoff on June 12, killing over 270 people, including students housed in a college hostel. Only one passenger survived. A preliminary report compiled by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) outlines what exactly went wrong in the final 32 seconds. **Key points from the preliminary report** 1. Both engines were shut down mid-air- Data shows fuel cutoff switches for both engines were moved from RUN to CUTOFF, one after the other. This caused a complete loss of thrust just seconds after liftoff. 2. Pilots appeared confused by the shutdown- Cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other: “Why did you cutoff?” The reply: “I didn't.” Investigators say this points to either an accidental switch movement or a system failure. 3. Aircraft was in the air for only 32 seconds- Takeoff was at 08:08:39 UTC. A 'Mayday' call was made at 08:09:05 UTC. The aircraft crashed by 08:09:11 UTC, just 0.9 nautical miles from the runway. 4. RAT deployed, confirming total power loss- Ram Air Turbine (RAT), a backup device for emergency power, was seen deploying on CCTV footage moments after engine shutdown. 5. Pilots attempted to restart the engines- The crew moved the fuel switches back to RUN. Engine 1 began recovering; Engine 2 failed to sustain power. Relight sequence was in progress when the crash occurred. 6. Thrust levers and data didn't match- Thrust levers were found at idle in the wreckage. But black box data showed they were still in takeoff position, hinting at a possible mechanical disconnect. 7. No external factors contributed- No birdstrike, no bad weather, and no fire were reported. Fuel was clean, and there were no dangerous goods onboard. 8. Crew medically fit and trained- Both pilots were well-rested, fit to fly, and experienced on the aircraft type. 9. FAA advisory on fuel switches was not followed- A 2018 FAA safety bulletin had warned about a potential flaw in the fuel control switch locking system on similar Boeing models. Air India did not perform the suggested inspection, as the advisory was not mandatory. 10. Aircraft hit medical hostel on descent. The aircraft struck five buildings, including a hostel of BJ Medical College. Parts of the aircraft were found spread across a debris field over 750 feet wide. 19 people on the ground were also killed. **What investigators found at the crash site-** Wreckage indicated the aircraft was in a nose-up attitude, with wings level at the time of impact. Both flight recorders were recovered, though the rear recorder was too damaged to extract data. The forward recorder revealed audio and data from six flights, including the crash flight. **Status of the ongoing investigation** Both engines have been quarantined and are under further examination. Post-mortem analysis, witness statements, and forensic testing are underway. So far, no safety directive has been issued for Boeing 787s or GE engines. **International Involvement** The probe includes experts from the NTSB (USA), Boeing, GE, and FAA. Investigators from UK, Portugal, and Canada also joined, as the victims included citizens from these countries.

reddit,1lxm8xl,InnerLog5062,2025-07-11T23:54:18Z,"Air India London Bound Flight UPDATE; PRELIMINARY REPORT: Air India pilot asked why fuel had been cut off moments before fatal crash Highly-anticipated report reveals shocking words from crew shortly before the Boeing ploughed into student hostel An Air India pilot asked why the doomed plane’s fuel had been cut off moments before it crashed. A highly-anticipated report released by Indian authorities just after midnight on Saturday said initial findings indicate switches controlling fuel flow to the jet’s two engines were turned off, leading to a catastrophic loss of thrust at take-off. All but one of 242 people on board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were killed when the aircraft plunged into a medical student hostel in a built-up suburb last month, less than a minute after take-off from Ahmedabad airport. Amid the confusion, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why “did you cut off” to the fuel supply in the recovered cockpit voice recording. The other pilot responded that he “didn’t”, according to the report released on Friday night by Indian authorities. The switches were then moved back to their normal position, which automatically started the process of relighting the engines. One of the engines was in the process of regaining power at the time the aircraft crashed. The other was relit but was not yet regaining thrust. “At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to [the engine operators and manufacturers], suggesting that no significant fault has been found with the plane or its engines,” the report reads. The findings explain why the jet’s emergency-power generator, known as a ram air turbine, appeared to have been activated moments before it plummeted to the ground. While the initial report does not draw any conclusion, it has raised questions about the actions of Sumeet Sabharwal, the lead pilot, and Clive Kundar, the co-pilot. The pilots had more than 9,000 hours of flying time between them. In the moments before disaster Sabharwal issued a mayday call. However, after the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of barely 400ft above the runway all contact was lost. **Air India report: Key findings** 1. Dual engine shutdown Both engines flamed out just seconds after take-off when fuel cut-off switches were inexplicably moved from ‘run’ to ‘cutoff’ in rapid succession. 2. Startling cockpit exchange Voice recordings captured one pilot urgently asking, ‘Why did you cut off?’ — met with a stunned reply, ‘I didn’t.’ 3. Total power failure caught on CCTV The emergency Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, a tell-tale sign of complete electrical loss, moments before impact. 4. Desperate restart bid Crews tried to relight the engines. Engine one flickered back to life briefly, but the second engine failed to recover. 5. Plunged in 32 seconds The aircraft remained airborne for barely half a minute, crashing less than a nautical mile from the runway into a hostel building. 6. Puzzling thrust lever mismatch Thrust levers were found idle post-crash, yet black box data showed take-off power still commanded, pointing to a possible mechanical disconnect. 7. Fuel ruled out Tests confirmed clean fuel, eliminating contamination or refuelling errors. 8. Normal take-off set-up Flaps and landing gear were correctly configured, with no sign of operational missteps. 9.Clear skies, pilots experienced No adverse weather, bird strikes or pilot health issues. Both aviators were certified, rested and experienced on this aircraft type. 10. No foul play detected yet No sabotage evident, but troublingly, Air India had skipped inspections despite an FAA alert over a known fuel switch vulnerability. 11. Aircraft loaded safely Within weight and balance limits, carrying no hazardous cargo.

Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route to London Gatwick, went down just seconds after take-off from Ahmedabad airport. Investigation is ongoing. **10 KEY POINTS IN REPORT** * Both fuel cutoff switches were moved from RUN to CUTOFF within one second after take-off, shutting down both engines midair. This simultaneous shutdown cut fuel supply and led to both engines losing thrust mid-air. * The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking, “Why did you cutoff?” to which the other responded, “I did not.” The brief exchange raises questions over possible technical malfunction or miscommunication in the cockpit. * The aircraft crashed into BJ Medical College hostel in Ahmedabad seconds after liftoff, killing all 260 onboard and on the ground. Of the 260 people who died, 241 were passengers and crew, while 19 were casualties on the ground. * The aircraft reached a top speed of 180 knots before both engines lost thrust simultaneously. The rapid loss of speed and altitude followed almost immediately after the fuel switches were flipped. * CCTV footage showed the Ram Air Turbine deploying immediately after liftoff - an emergency system triggered by power loss. The RAT typically activates during power loss, confirming that the engines had shut down mid-air. * After the initial cutoff, both fuel switches were moved back to RUN; one engine briefly stabilized, but the other failed to recover. Engine 2 showed signs of brief recovery, but Engine 1 failed to stabilise and thrust could not be regained. * Investigators found no evidence of bird activity near the flight path, ruling it out as a possible cause. This eliminated bird strike as a cause for the dual engine failure after take-off. * Despite throttles being at takeoff setting until impact, both were found in idle position post-crash due to thermal damage. The AAIB noted this was likely due to severe thermal damage in the crash aftermath. * The aircraft’s forward Extended Airframe Flight Recorder (EAFR) was recovered and successfully downloaded. However, the aft EAFR was too badly damaged to retrieve data through conventional means. * Components of interest have been quarantined; at this stage, no advisory has been issued to Boeing or GE engine operators. The AAIB has not issued any advisory yet to Boeing or GE, as the root cause is still under investigation.",20,4,0,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaTodayLIVE/comments/1lxrmqf/indias_aaib_has_released_its_preliminary_report/,0.024,0.834,0.141,-0.9936,0.21428571428571427,0.3333333333333333,0.047619047619047616,0.21428571428571427,0.09523809523809523,0.09523809523809523,sadness

I just finished reading the preliminary AAIB report on the Air India B787 crash (VT-ANB) that occurred in Ahmedabad on 12 June 2025. The report includes some flight recorder data and cockpit voice excerpts (e.g., one pilot asking “why did you cutoff?”), but it’s still a very filtered version. As someone following international aviation safety, I’ve noticed that countries like the U.S. (NTSB) sometimes publish full CVR transcripts (not audio), especially in high-profile accidents (e.g., Atlas Air 3591, Colgan Air 3407), and France’s BEA often includes detailed technical appendices and CVR summaries in their final reports. Even the MH370 investigation included a lot of raw radar and satellite data. In India, though, there seems to be a strict non-disclosure culture around raw data like ATC recordings, CVR, FDR traces, etc., possibly due to security concerns. Even ATC recordings are prohibited from public circulation, which limits independent analysis. So my questions are: Is there any precedent for India ever releasing full FDR or CVR transcripts to the public? Is this a legal limitation under Indian aviation law, or just policy? Do ICAO rules (Annex 13) allow countries to keep this level of data private even in global investigations? What could be done (legally or through RTI) to improve transparency in such cases?

Here are the key points from the report: Key Findings: 1. Dual Engine Shutdown: Both engines shut down mid-air due to fuel cutoff switches being moved from RUN to CUTOFF, causing a complete loss of thrust seconds after liftoff. 2. Pilot Confusion: Cockpit audio revealed pilot confusion, with one asking, ""Why did you cutoff?"" and the other replying, ""I didn't,"" suggesting accidental switch movement or system failure. 3. Brief Flight Time: The aircraft was in the air for only 32 seconds, with a 'Mayday' call made at 08:09:05 UTC and the crash occurring just 6 seconds later. 4. Total Power Loss: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, confirming total power loss. 5. Engine Restart Attempt: Pilots attempted to restart engines, but only Engine 1 showed signs of recovery. 6. Thrust Lever Discrepancy: Thrust levers were found at idle in the wreckage, but black box data showed they were still in takeoff position, hinting at a possible mechanical disconnect. 7. No External Factors: No birdstrike, bad weather, or fire were reported, and fuel was clean with no dangerous goods onboard. 8. Crew Fit and Trained: Both pilots were well-rested, fit to fly, and experienced on the aircraft type. 9. FAA Advisory Not Followed: A 2018 FAA safety bulletin warned about a potential flaw in the fuel control switch locking system, but Air India did not perform the suggested inspection. 10. Devastating Impact: The aircraft struck multiple buildings, including a medical hostel, killing 19 people on the ground. Investigation Status: - Both engines have been quarantined for further examination. - Post-mortem analysis, witness statements, and forensic testing are underway. - International experts from the NTSB, Boeing, GE, FAA, and other countries are involved in the probe.

The Boeing 787 struck a hostel building shortly after takeoff, resulting in a post-crash fire.* # Overview of the Accident and Preliminary Findings **Flight and Crash Summary:** On June 12, 2025, Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (registration VT-ANB) bound for London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The aircraft lifted off normally at 08:08:39 UTC, but within seconds it ceased climbing and fell into a college hostel about 0.9 nautical miles from the runway end. Tragically, 260 people were killed (241 of 242 onboard and 19 on the ground), making it India’s worst aviation disaster in decades. Only one passenger survived with serious injuries. **Key Black Box Revelations:** Preliminary data from the flight recorders (the Boeing 787’s Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders) revealed a *highly unusual and critical event* moments after liftoff. At 08:08:42 UTC, just as the jet reached about 180 knots airspeed and began initial climb, the **fuel control switches for both engines** *moved from “RUN” to “CUTOFF”* one after the other, just one second apart. This action cut off fuel flow to both of the jet’s General Electric GEnx engines, causing an immediate loss of thrust. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot urgently ask the other *“Why did you cutoff?”* – to which the second pilot replied *“I did not”*, indicating both were bewildered by the sudden shutoff. Within seconds, both engines began winding down due to fuel starvation. The crew reacted almost immediately: by 08:08:52, just \~10 seconds after the cutoff, one pilot had toggled the **Engine 1 fuel switch back to RUN**, and four seconds later did the same for Engine 2. The 787’s automatic systems (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) attempted engine *relight* sequences as soon as fuel was reintroduced. Engine #1 showed some recovery in core RPM, and Engine #2 tried to relight but struggled to accelerate, repeatedly adding fuel in an attempt to regain power. Unfortunately, the aircraft had only been airborne for roughly **30 seconds** in total. At such a low altitude (only a few hundred feet) there was not enough time or height to complete an engine restart. The plane rapidly lost altitude and could not stay airborne. At 08:09:05, one of the pilots managed to transmit a brief **“MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY”** distress call; just seconds after, at around 08:09:11, the flight data recorder stopped, consistent with the moment of impact. **Crash Impact and Wreckage:** The nearly fully-fueled widebody jet struck the multi-story hostel building in a nose-up, wings-level attitude (estimated \~8° nose-up)【0†p.8】. The impact and subsequent inferno destroyed the aircraft and caused major structural damage to five buildings【0†p.6】【0†p.8】. Wreckage was strewn across a 1000×400 ft area【0†p.6-p.7】. Both pilots and 10 cabin crew perished, along with virtually all passengers. On the ground, 19 people in the hostel lost their lives【0†p.5\]. The investigation team recovered both flight recorders (albeit damaged by impact and fire) and key aircraft components for further analysis【0†p.12-p.13】. **Weather and Takeoff Conditions:** There were no adverse meteorological factors – weather was clear, visibility \~6 km, and light winds around 6–7 knots【0†p.11】. The takeoff weight (\~213,400 kg) was within permissible limits (below the 218,000 kg max for conditions)【0†p.13】. The flaps were set to 5° (the normal takeoff setting), dispelling early speculation that an incorrect flap configuration might have caused a loss of lift. The aircraft’s maintenance log showed no active critical defects: all mandatory Airworthiness Directives had been complied with, and only minor MEL items (unrelated to engines or flight controls) were deferred at the time【0†p.5-p.6】. The pilots were experienced and adequately rested (the 56-year-old captain had \~8,600 hours on the 787, and the 32-year-old first officer about 1,100 hours on type). In summary, nothing in the environment, loading, or crew condition explains the sudden loss of power – all evidence points to that *mysterious dual engine shutdown* right after takeoff. # The Critical Event: Uncommanded Dual Engine Shutdown Investigators have zeroed in on the **fuel control switches** because their uncommanded movement to CUTOFF was the direct trigger of the catastrophe. These guarded switches (one for each engine) are essentially the engine “fuel on/off” controls – they’re normally kept in **RUN** once engines are started, and only moved to **CUTOFF** to shut an engine down (on the ground or in an emergency). It is virtually unheard of for *both* engines to shut down simultaneously right after takeoff, especially due to the fuel switches being toggled – an action that ordinarily would require a deliberate, physical move by the crew. **Design of Fuel Control Switches:** In the Boeing 787 cockpit (and Boeing airliners generally), the fuel switches are located on the center console just below the thrust levers. They are designed with safety features to prevent accidental operation. Each switch is spring-loaded to stay in position and has a protective gate or **mechanical locking mechanism** – the pilot must *lift a guard or lever* to move the switch from RUN to CUTOFF or vice versa. In other words, one cannot simply bump or knock these switches down; a deliberate upward lift and toggle motion is required, and they are flanked by brackets to shield against stray contact. As former FAA accident investigator Jeff Guzzetti noted, *“each switch has a mechanical lock...it’s highly unlikely for switches like this to be inadvertently moved absent some mechanical failure.”*. This built-in robustness is why the recorded event is so baffling: **how could both guarded fuel switches flip to CUTOFF on their own?** **Potential Mechanical/System Malfunction:** One leading theory is a technical malfunction in the throttle control module or the switch locking mechanism. Notably, the preliminary report highlighted a **2018 FAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB)** that warned of potential disengagement of the fuel switch locking feature on some Boeing models. This advisory (SAIB NM-18-33) was prompted by reports on Boeing 737s where fuel switches were found with their locks not engaged, which could allow unintended movement. The Boeing 787 uses a similar switch design (part number 4TL837-3D). However, because the FAA did not consider it an immediate unsafe condition, **no mandatory directive** was issued. Air India acknowledged it did *not* perform the optional inspection to verify the locking mechanism, since it was “advisory and not mandatory”. It is conceivable that a defect or mis-rigging in these switches or their locks existed unbeknownst to the airline. The throttle quadrant on this aircraft had been replaced in 2019 and again in 2023 (for unrelated reasons). If, for example, the locking pin or spring was incorrectly installed or later failed, the switches *might* have been able to slip to CUTOFF under certain forces. Consider that at the moment of rotation, the aircraft experiences a sudden pitch-up and possibly a slight negative G or jolt; if the locks were disengaged or weak, that motion *combined with vibration or throttle movement* could potentially make a switch snap to CUTOFF. Investigators will be examining the recovered switch hardware (if salvageable) to see if any mechanical failure or wear in the locking mechanism is evident. Another possible mechanical factor involves automation: modern jets have protective logics (for example, Boeing’s **Thrust Control Malfunction Accommodation (TCMA)** system) that respond to engine anomalies. One veteran pilot, Capt. Shakti Lumba, speculated that a glitch in such a system *“could have commanded the valves to close after sensing an issue”*. TCMA is intended to adjust thrust or even shut down an engine in case of severe malfunction (like a sudden uncommanded thrust or engine separation) to protect the aircraft. If sensors falsely indicated a grave problem on both engines (an extremely rare scenario), a TCMA-like function could, in theory, cut fuel supply. However, the likelihood of both engines triggering such a response simultaneously is very low, and Boeing has not indicated any known issue of this sort on the 787. Investigators will nonetheless scrutinize engine and flight control software for any anomalies around that moment. **Human Factors – Pilot Action (or Error?):** Given the improbability of an accidental bump, the scenario of *pilot error or intentional action* must also be weighed, however uncomfortable. Could one of the pilots have inadvertently or mistakenly pulled the fuel shutoff switches? The CVR conversation strongly suggests confusion rather than acknowledgment – one pilot accusing the other of cutting off fuel and immediate denial. This does not sound like a crew knowingly executing a procedure; it sounds like neither expected this to happen. Both pilots were experienced and described as fit and well-rested, and the takeoff until that instant was normal. There was no obvious reason for either pilot to shut down an engine, let alone both, intentionally. Standard procedure for any engine abnormality after V1 (takeoff decision speed) would be to **keep climbing on the remaining engine**, not to shut it down. As a former Indian Airlines commander put it, *“No pilot on takeoff would switch off both their engines. It doesn’t make any sense.”*. What about an **inadvertent error**? History has a few rare cases of pilots accidentally causing dual-engine shutdowns. For instance, in the 1980s a Delta Air Lines 767 flight experienced a scare when a pilot mistakenly cut fuel to *both* engines in cruise – luckily at high altitude, allowing time to realize and restart. Distraction or miscommunication can lead to switches being moved in the wrong position, though it’s exceedingly uncommon, especially on takeoff. In this Air India case, perhaps if one engine had shown signs of failure (say severe vibrations or fire), the crew might have rushed to shut it down, and in a moment of confusion **could they have pulled the wrong switch – or even both?** This would require a lapse in basic CRM, but one cannot entirely rule out a momentary cockpit mistake. Investigators will delve into the CVR for any hint that the crew perceived an engine problem or called for a shutdown before the event. So far, the only voices captured are the surprised queries after the fact, with no prior discussion of engine issues. The most extreme human factor scenario would be a **deliberate act** by one of the pilots (i.e. sabotage or suicide). Unfortunately, aviation history has examples of pilots intentionally crashing aircraft. Experts note that any time a crash is not readily explainable, nothing can be dismissed initially. However, in this instance, the evidence leans against intentional sabotage: the pilots attempted to restart the engines and issued a mayday call, which is the opposite of a willful crash scenario. A rogue pilot would not try to regain power or alert ATC; they would likely nose the plane down or otherwise prevent recovery. Both crew members here fought to save the aircraft until the end. Thus, while a *malicious act* is theoretically a “potential possibility,” it is considered highly unlikely given the crew’s actions and will presumably be ruled out as the investigation checks the pilots’ backgrounds and psychological profiles. **Other External Possibilities:** Investigators also examined whether any outside factors could have caused dual engine failure. One early theory was **fuel contamination** – if both engines were fed bad fuel (with water or contaminant) they might flame out. However, fuel samples from the airport fuel supply passed tests as normal. Only very small samples could be retrieved from the crashed aircraft’s fuel system (due to the fire), but those will be tested as well. At this point there’s *no evidence* that fuel quality was an issue, and crucially, a flameout from contaminated fuel would not physically flip the cockpit switches to CUTOFF (the engines would stop, but the switches would still be in RUN). In this crash, the FDR explicitly recorded the switches moving to cutoff, distinguishing it from a simple flameout scenario. Likewise, a **bird strike** or foreign object ingestion was considered – could both engines have ingested birds on takeoff and failed? Ahmedabad airport CCTV captured the plane’s departure and showed no significant bird activity near the flight path【0†p.14】. A large bird (or drone strike) in each engine simultaneously is astronomically improbable, and again would not cause the fuel selector switches to toggle (engines would be damaged but the switches would remain in RUN). No bird remains were reported in the wreckage. Thus, classic causes of dual engine failure like fuel starvation (pilots mismanaging fuel) or volcanic ash, etc., are not applicable on a takeoff from a domestic airport with full tanks. All signs point back to the *fuel control mechanism*. # Could the Disaster Have Been Averted? Given the preliminary facts, this accident appears to stem from a *singular anomalous event* – the sudden loss of both engines’ power due to fuel cutoff. Once that occurred at such a low altitude, the fate of the flight was almost sealed. As aviation consultant Capt. Ross Aimer bluntly stated, *“At that altitude, there’s no chance in hell that they can relight \[the engines\] in time to gain speed and altitude.”*. The 787 effectively became a 250-ton glider only a few hundred feet above ground – there was simply not enough height or time to recover. The pilots did everything possible by quickly toggling the fuel back on and calling mayday, but physics was against them. So, **the avoidance had to come before the engines ever shut down**. In other words, prevention of the precipitating event is key. Here are the measures and lessons that emerge: * **Addressing the Fuel Switch Lock Issue:** If a mechanical malfunction of the fuel control switches is confirmed, then ensuring those switches cannot inadvertently move is paramount. Air India and other operators could have performed the inspection recommended by the FAA’s 2018 bulletin. Had such an inspection been done, it might have identified any mis-installed or faulty lock in the throttle quadrant. Going forward, even before the final report, airlines operating 787s (and other Boeing models with similar fuel switches) would be wise to double-check the integrity of the fuel switch locking mechanism. What was *optional* advice should perhaps become mandatory via an Airworthiness Directive if the investigation finds it to be causal. In hindsight, treating the SAIB’s concern with more urgency – either by Boeing/FAA elevating it to a requirement, or by operators proactively complying – **might have prevented this accident** if indeed a lock failure is to blame. Air India’s preliminary response noted they were in compliance with all mandatory directives, subtly underscoring that the fuel lock bulletin was “advisory, not mandatory”. This tragedy may prompt regulators to rethink that stance on seemingly minor issues that could have major consequences. * **System Design and Redundancy:** The 787, like all airliners, is designed with redundancy – it can fly safely on one engine, and it has backup electrical/hydraulic power (as evidenced by the Ram Air Turbine deploying) to keep controls active during total power loss. However, one area that might be scrutinized is whether any *automatic cutoff triggers* should have additional safeguards. If the investigation leans towards an automated command (via TCMA or otherwise) shutting the fuel valves due to bad sensor input, then Boeing would need to ensure such systems are failsafe. For example, requiring cross-verification between multiple sensors before an automatic dual-engine shutdown, or perhaps inhibiting any automated engine shutdown in the critical seconds after takeoff unless absolutely necessary. Typically, autopilot or auto-throttle systems do not have authority to cut fuel – it usually requires pilot action – so any finding of spurious system command would likely lead to software updates. At this stage, however, no evidence of a broad design flaw has emerged; Boeing has stated there are no indications of inherent faults in the 787 or GEnx engines needing urgent action. * **Pilot Training and Procedures:** From the human factors side, while the crew here appear to have been caught off-guard by something outside normal experience, there may still be training takeaways. Pilots practice engine failures on takeoff in simulators, but the standard scenario is one engine *inoperative*, not both. A dual-engine failure immediately after liftoff is so dire that it’s not part of routine training (since recovery is unlikely). Perhaps more relevant is training on recognizing **erroneous actions** – for instance, if a pilot inadvertently reaches for the wrong control. In this case, if one pilot had erroneously pulled a fuel switch, would the other catch it in time? Crew Resource Management (CRM) emphasizes verbal callouts and confirmation for critical actions. Arguably, any move to shut down an engine in flight (especially below safe altitude) should be confirmed by the other pilot. Reinforcing this “two-to-check” rule for fuel shutoff might prevent an accidental or premature engine cutoff. It’s possible that future 787 procedures could include a call like “Confirm cutoff Engine 1/2?” if ever needed, to ensure no mix-up. That said, this event happened *so fast* that the crew had no warning or discussion until after the fact. They did manage to identify what happened (hence the query “why did you cutoff?”) within seconds – but not in time to undo it. * **Operational Policies:** One consideration is the use of the **APU (Auxiliary Power Unit)** during takeoff. Some airlines run the APU (a small backup engine) to provide an extra power source during critical phases, which can help in case both main engines fail (it can supply electrical/hydraulic power without the delay of RAT deployment). In this flight, the APU was likely off for takeoff (common practice to save wear); when both engines quit, the APU auto-started but didn’t fully spool up before the crash【0†p.14-p.15】. Having the APU already running might have kept instruments and hydraulics powered a couple of seconds sooner, though it would not provide thrust or significantly change the outcome here. Still, some operators might review whether keeping the APU on until reaching a safe altitude could provide any safety margin in rare dual-engine loss scenarios. * **Airfield and Route Considerations:** Unfortunately, the area off the end of Runway 23 at Ahmedabad is populated (the aircraft struck a building in a dense part of the city). With no engines and low height, the crew had virtually no choice of where to go – they came down roughly along the extended runway centerline. In theory, nothing could be done at that point to “avoid” obstacles; the glide distance was too short. The only mitigation is preventing the loss of power in the first place. This crash will likely renew discussion on obstacle clearance near airports and emergency landings, but a plane that loses both engines at \~300 feet is essentially unrecoverable no matter the environment. **Summary:** The most plausible way this catastrophe *could have been avoided* is by addressing the root cause – i.e., ensuring the fuel to the engines was never inadvertently cut off. That points to maintenance diligence (following up on known issues like the fuel switch lock) and possibly design changes if a flaw is confirmed. It might also prompt a re-evaluation of whether additional cockpit warnings could be implemented: for example, if a fuel lever goes to cutoff in flight, does the system immediately alert “Engine shutoff” in a clear way? (Pilots did notice instantly in this case, but an unmistakable warning might aid response in time under slightly higher altitude scenarios.) Ultimately, once the final investigation pinpoints *why* the switches moved to CUTOFF, the industry can take specific corrective action – be it replacing a faulty component fleetwide, revising a checklist, or updating software logic. # Conclusion and Ongoing Investigation In conclusion, all evidence so far indicates that Air India Flight 171 crashed because **both engines lost power seconds after takeoff** due to an *uncommanded fuel cutoff*. The exact reason *why* the fuel control switches toggled off is the central mystery that investigators are aggressively examining. Possible causes range from a mechanical failure in the switch locking mechanism, to an extremely unlikely pilot error, or a freak automation/sensor glitch – with mechanical/design issues being the prime suspect at this stage. Crucially, multiple independent experts have noted that accidental movement of these switches should be nearly impossible barring a malfunction. As such, the investigation is focusing on how a known design safeguard might have failed. The final report (expected within a year) will likely provide a definitive cause or sequence of causes leading to the dual engine shutdown. The tragedy underscores the axiom that aviation safety improvements are often written in blood. Already, the preliminary findings have alerted 787 operators and Boeing to this potential vulnerability. Airlines worldwide will be watching for any immediate directives – even though Indian authorities have not issued any new recommendations yet. Moving forward, we can expect enhanced scrutiny on similar fuel control systems across fleets, and if needed, retrofits or changes to ensure *no other flight can suffer this fate*. In the meantime, investigators continue to analyze flight data, perform forensic tests on wreckage, interview witnesses (including the lone survivor), and reconstruct the sequence in greater detail. There is also ongoing analysis of crew histories and maintenance records for any overlooked clues. Every facet, from human factors to hardware to software, is being reviewed to understand how a state-of-the-art airliner could lose both engines so suddenly. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis points to a confluence of factors with one critical trigger. Had that trigger been removed – whether by a prior maintenance check, a more fail-safe design, or simply by sheer luck of it not occurring – this flight would have continued uneventfully. Sadly, the lessons from the loss of Flight 171 will now drive improvements to prevent such an accident from ever happening again. The goal of the investigation, as the report’s foreword emphasizes, is not to assign blame, but to ensure that the circumstances leading to this crash are fully understood and addressed【0†p.2】. By doing so, the aviation community can *avert future tragedies* and honor the memory of those who lost their lives in this incident. **Sources:** * Preliminary Accident Report, AAIB India (July 2025). * The Indian Express – *“Engine fuel switches were cut off...

The disaster killed 241 passengers and crew and 19 people on the ground, leaving just one survivor. India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) confirmed no mechanical failure but highlighted a chilling anomaly: both fuel control switches were toggled from “RUN” to “CUTOFF” within seconds after liftoff. Cockpit voice recordings captured an exchange between the pilots: > Pilot 1: “Did you cut off (fuel)?” Pilot 2: “I didn’t do so.” This seemingly impossible sequence has fueled theories about a remote sabotage, rooted in Boeing’s own 2006 patent (US714971B2) for autonomous aircraft override systems. --- 🔥 The Boeing Patent: Anti-Hijack or Trojan Horse? Filed post-9/11, Boeing’s patent allows ground operators to seize control of an aircraft in case of hijacking, using an “alternative power control element” like a Ram Air Turbine (RAT). In Flight 171’s case, the RAT deployed as both engines shut down—a standard response to power loss but also a possible sign of external intervention. Critics argue this system, intended as a safety net, could be weaponized to take down an airliner. --- 🏛 Trump, Boeing, and Gulf Royals: The $400 Million Question While India mourned, another story unfolded quietly: former U.S. President Donald Trump’s closed-door meetings with Boeing executives and Qatari royals, tied to a $400 million Boeing jumbo jet “gift”. Was it just a high-end VVIP jet deal? Or part of a larger geopolitical transaction? Consider the timing: Qatar seeking protection guarantees amid Gulf rivalries. Trump acting as an intermediary for Boeing, whose Dreamliner program faces scrutiny after multiple crashes. Gulf monarchies investing heavily in U.S. aerospace and defense to cement their relationships. Could these interactions have created a permissive environment for certain state or corporate actors to deploy technologies outside their original intent? --- 🌐 Five Eyes: The Watchers in the Shadows The Five Eyes alliance (U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) possesses unparalleled surveillance and cyber capabilities. Analysts speculate that with advanced satellite systems and access to aircraft systems (via vulnerabilities like SATCOM or ACARS), such groups could theoretically execute a remote override. Some point to Operation Sindoor—India’s May 2025 strikes on Pakistan—as a potential trigger. Was Flight 171 carrying a VVIP linked to Indian defense or intelligence, making it a target of “covert retaliation”? --- 🕵️‍♀️ The Sarah Adams Tweet: Coincidence or Warning? Adding fuel to the fire, a resurfaced tweet from Sarah Adams, a former CIA targeting officer, raised eyebrows: > “You get the biggest attack that India will ever see on its soil is currently being planned in Afghanistan—good luck with that! And go fuck yourself!” (Tweet posted on 09/06/25—three days before Flight 171 crashed) Was this an idle rant? Or an ominous leak of an impending “operation” involving India? --- ⚖️ Counterarguments: A Technical Fluke? Skeptics argue the switch anomaly could stem from: Pilot error under stress. An electrical fault causing inadvertent switch movement. RAT deployment being a routine reaction to power loss. AAIB’s preliminary report found no evidence of mechanical failure—but neither did it explain why the switches moved. --- 📖 Pattern or Coincidence? Boeing crashes during and after Trump’s tenures have sparked global scrutiny: Lion Air Flight 610 (2018) – 737 MAX. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019) – 737 MAX. Southwest Flight 2443 (2025) – 737-800. Air India Flight 171 (2025) – 787 Dreamliner. Is it bad luck, or something more sinister tied to geopolitics and corporate interests? --- 🔥 Conclusion: Accident or Message?

Seeking Advice/Experiences Hey everyone in r/CPTSD, I'm a 31-year-old entrepreneur from a small city in India, and I've been dealing with what feels like a never-ending storm since October 2024. I've lurked here for a while, but this is my first post. I want to share my story to see if anyone relates or has insights—especially on whether this sounds like CPTSD, how to heal without meds (I've quit antidepressants), and if recovery is possible. I'm scared it's permanent, but I need hope or real talk from those who've been through similar hell. Quick Background on My Traumas (October 2024): It all hit at once, like a perfect storm: - **Breakup/Ghosting:** Met a woman on a dating app in Ahmedabad; we had an intense 15-day connection. She ghosted me, moved abroad, and started a new relationship. It shattered my self-worth—I realized it was more about validation during my business success than real love. Thoughts of her still pop up, but they're less painful now. - **Near-Fatal Car Accident:** Right after meeting her, I got news of my grandmother's passing and hired a driver to rush back to my hometown. He fell asleep, and we crashed into a truck at 3 AM. I survived with a broken clavicle (healed without surgery), but it was traumatic—bad injuries, hospital stay, and she visited once before ghosting. - **Grandmother's Passing:** Happened the same day as the breakup meeting, compounding the grief. - **Business Crisis:** My company(built from scratch to a million-dollar business over 7 years), faced near-collapse right after. I resolved it while injured, but it added massive burnout. Before this, I was happy, confident, and resilient. Now, it's like my nervous system is stuck in survival mode. **My Symptoms (Started Post-Trauma, Ongoing for ~9 Months):** - **Panic Attacks and Anxiety:** 3-4 per day for months, unpredictable, often all-day. Triggers include visiting accident/breakup site and business stress. I've had hypervigilance, derealization (""nothing feels real""), and a ""heavy head"" sensation. - **Cognitive Issues:** Brain fog, hard to think clearly or remember recent things (feels like digging into the distant past). - **Emotional Patterns:** Irritability, low self-worth (""not good enough"" from breakup), mood swings (brief happiness to panic). Fears of ""irreversible damage"" or ""losing my mind."" - **Physical/Other:** Burnout from ongoing bussiness crises, no medication now (quit antidepressants due to side effects/withdrawal; they didn't help). I suspect CPTSD or vagus nerve dysregulation from the traumas—symptoms match what I've read, like being stuck in fight/flight. No formal diagnosis, as I've lost trust in doctors after unhelpful prescriptions. **What I've Tried and Progress So Far:** - **Quitting Stuff:** Stopped antidepressants (tapered after withdrawal hell) and weed. - **Natural Approaches:** Started CBD oil (low dose) and magnesium L-Threonate for anxiety/sleep. Daily vagus nerve stimulation (deep breathing, humming, cold exposure). - **Challenges:** Nonlinear recovery—panic still hits, business crises amplify stress. Triggers like old songs bring tears and urges to check her socials (I resist, but it's hard). **What I'm Asking the Community:** - Does this sound like CPTSD to you? Any similar stories of layered traumas (breakup + accident + loss + crisis) and how you healed? - For those with vagus nerve issues: How did you know if it was physical damage vs. dysregulation? Any natural methods that actually worked long-term? - Will I be okay? Is this constant struggle forever, or does it get better? I'm almost a year in and scared it's permanent—need real experiences, not platitudes. - Tips for managing triggers (e.g., memories of ex) and business stress without meds? I'm doing it independently now. Thanks for reading my wall of text. This community has given me hope just by existing. Any advice or ""I've been there"" stories would mean the world. TL;DR: Layered traumas in Oct 2024 left me with panic, brain fog, voice issues, and fear of permanent damage.

reddit,1lyz4lt,GreenPipsTradingLTD,2025-07-13T17:52:51Z,"Breaking News # Boeing Under Pressure After Deadly Air India Crash — What It Means for Investors A tragic aviation disaster has placed Boeing back under the spotlight after an Air India Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, killing 241 people, including 53 British nationals. The only survivor was a British passenger seated near the rear of the aircraft. # What We Know So Far Flight AI171, en route to London Gatwick, lost all engine power within seconds of becoming airborne. Investigators have confirmed that the aircraft's engines were abruptly cut off after both fuel control levers shifted into the “cut-off” position. This action starved the engines of fuel and caused the plane to lose thrust. Data retrieved from the black box revealed a cockpit exchange between the pilots, with one expressing confusion about the engine shutdown and the other denying responsibility. Although the engines attempted to restart mid-air, only one regained partial power—insufficient to prevent the crash. India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released a preliminary report, pointing out that the unusual shift in fuel controls occurred within a second of liftoff. While no mechanical fault has been officially declared, the incident bears similarities to earlier warnings by U.S. regulators about unsecured fuel switch locking systems in Boeing jets. # How This Could Hit Boeing Stock Boeing (NYSE: BA), which recently saw positive momentum thanks to improved aircraft deliveries and the resolution of a key legal case, could now face a significant reputational and financial setback. # Investor Risks: * **Renewed regulatory scrutiny** is likely. If a design flaw or systemic issue is confirmed, Boeing could be forced into fleet inspections or software/hardware overhauls. * **Legal liability** may follow if Boeing is found to bear responsibility for a manufacturing or systems failure. * **Order slowdowns** could emerge, especially as some airlines, including Air India, are reportedly scaling back wide-body operations after the crash. # Market Sentiment: * Before the crash, analysts had upgraded Boeing’s price targets to as high as $275, citing strong commercial momentum. * Now, bearish scenarios are resurfacing. Wells Fargo has flagged downside risk toward $113 per share, citing cash flow weaknesses—concerns that this tragedy could magnify. # Bottom Line This catastrophic incident comes at a fragile time for Boeing. While the cause remains under investigation, any indication that aircraft systems malfunctioned due to a design or software fault could fuel regulatory delays, erode customer trust, and weigh heavily on the company’s stock. Investors should watch closely for updates from Indian authorities and Boeing’s Q2 earnings call, as these will shape the market’s next move on BA shares.",0,0,0,https://reddit.com/r/GreenPipsTrading/comments/1lyz4lt/breaking_news/,0.066,0.783,0.151,-0.9916,0.1206896551724138,0.27586206896551724,0.05172413793103448,0.3620689655172414,0.1206896551724138,0.06896551724137931,fear

reddit,1lzo3ab,MostCardiologist4934,2025-07-14T14:37:01Z,"AI 171 Crash: An Alternate Theory [OC] There’s been a lot of talk about pilot sabotage and pilot error but I’d like to discuss another possible theory: Part A: What the report says: Around 3 seconds after takeoff, both engine fuel control switches “transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF” one second apart. What is missing: The prelim report only mentions that the fuel switch state “TRANSITIONED” to CUTOFF not specifically that the switches were physically moved by the pilots. Some loopholes I noticed: The distinction between “transition” and “move” has deliberately not being made YET and this is important because: a) The switch state is logged as discrete electronic data not a mechanical movement log. The FDR records the binary state of the switch (RUN or CUTOFF) and cannot alone confirm manual movement. [Check page 9, section 1.2.1 [here](https://bea.aero/uploads/tx_scalaetudessecurite/use.of.fdr_01.pdf?) ] b) My very broad understanding of the ‘flow of data’ for the fuel switch’s electrical position is: Fuel Control Switch —> Remote Data Concentrator (RDC) —> Common Core System (CCS) —> Flight Data Recorder (FDR) So along this signal path, could an electrical fault, transient glitch, or miscommunication in the data path cause the FDR to log an incorrect switch state, even if the physical lever was never moved? c) Here’s how the word “transition” is ALSO used by aviation reports: From the NTSB Investigation DCA16FA217: “Cabin altitude warning parameter had transitioned from ‘No Warn’ to ‘Warn’ 1 second later.” So this was a system-logged change and the word “transitioned” here refers to logic/event detection not physical movement of anything. From the Jackson Hole, WY overrun incident report: “FDR data showed that, about 1 second after initial touchdown, the ‘ground’ signal transitioned back to ‘air’ mode for about 0.5 second before transitioning back to ‘ground’ mode for the remainder of the landing roll.” Again, the word “transitioned” refers to a sensor logic change not actual physical movement of anything c) The simplest way to confirm if a pilot physically moved the fuel switches is to check for click sounds on the CVR. Those toggles make a distinct noise. Audio forensics can isolate and amplify such sounds. But the report makes no mention of this. No confirmation, no denial. Yet. Part B: What the report says: “In the cockpit voice recording one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so” (Exact quote from the report) What is missing: While the report includes the events that transpired, it doesn’t provide them in a clear itemized timeline. People are piecing together the timeline themselves which leaves room for misinterpretation. Some loopholes I noticed: a) The comment “Why did you cut off?” is being assumed to have occurred right after the switches were moved to CUTOFF implying deliberate action by a pilot. But where is the evidence that this line was said at that point in time? It could have occurred later, perhaps even after they realized both engines were down or even after Mayday was declared. b) Without a time-stamped transcript, the full context and the ability to gauge tone is completely lost. People are dissecting and reading into these 2 lines way too much when you don’t even know when it was said and how it was said (tone, filler words, pauses) d) IFALPA, the global pilots’ federation has pushed back against the idea of blaming pilot error or sabotage without conclusive proof [Read [here](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-india-plane-crash-report-raises-questions-but-has-no-answers-global-body-ahmedabad-london-ai-171-8876983/amp/1) ] e) If one pilot saw the other cut the fuel, why wait 10 seconds to reverse it? Any trained pilot would instantly undo such a reckless action. A pause that long doesn’t align with a real time reaction if the claim is that he SAW it happening in front of him. Shock, fear and hierarchy in the cockpit can play a part yes, but I still find it unlikely in this case. f) If this was deliberate sabotage, why try to restart the engines seconds later? That would not be typical behavior for someone trying to sabotage the plane. Some suggested that the 10 second gap in reaction was due to the pilots grappling with each other. If there was a fight or struggle in the cockpit, the CVR would’ve picked it up. But the report doesn’t mention anything. No confirmation or denial. PART C What the report says: -Point 13, page 15- “At this stage of the investigation, there are no recommended actions to B 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators or manufacturers”. -Point 4, page 6- “…There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB” What people are saying: These 2 specific points are being used to suggest that system related failures have been completely ruled out with finality but that’s not true. Loopholes: a) point 13 says “At this stage of the investigation…” meaning that the investigation is still ongoing and no conclusive systemic fault has yet been officially identified. It does not rule out the possibility of technical or electrical fault, it only means that investigators are not yet ready to make safety recommendations without more evidence. b) Point 4 only means no prior recorded or reported defect of this nature on this specific aircraft (since 2023). It does NOT mean the switches or wiring was functioning correctly during the incident itself. Air India Express was recently flagged for delaying mandatory maintenance and FALSIFYING records to fake compliance. So documentation alone isn’t always trustworthy [Details [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/regulators-warned-air-india-express-about-delay-airbus-engine-fix-forging-2025-07-04/) ] c) The prelim report does not confirm whether a teardown of the fuel control switches, wiring harnesses, RDC connectors or related components was performed as yet or not. There’s no mention of lab analysis, bench testing or photographic documentation of the physical hardware. Till that info comes in, ruling out hardware or system failure is premature. Part D: Here’s my version of the chronology: -The switches were never physically moved to CUTOFF. They remained in RUN. -A momentary internal/system fault tricked the logic into registering a “transition” to CUTOFF. -Pilots reacted in shock to sudden fuel cutoff alarms and error messages and words were exchanged (“Why did you cutoff…”). they then attempted to fix it by toggling the fuel switches back and forth. There may have been a few failed toggles before the system finally read a clean RUN command and the fuel started flowing in. This is what probably took 10 seconds. -The actual physical movement of the switches likely happened after the loss of thrust, during recovery attempts. PART E Breaking down the possibility of electrical/systems issue: a) Its true that each engine has its own fuel cutoff switch and is designed to operate independently. But is full isolation guaranteed all the way through? These switches pass through certain systems like RDCs and CCS which may involve shared wiring harnesses, grounding points or interface logic, leaving room for vulnerabilities (Without access to Boeing’s proprietary wiring schematics and manuals, this point will be hard to prove OR disprove) The incident in Osaka [here](https://www.kjmtoday.com/single-post/2019/01/23/aviation-787-dual-engine-shutdown), MIT research [here](http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2023/2023-06-06-1010__John-Thomas__PUB.pdf) , shows that a possible shared logic fault (in this case via TCMA) can override both engines simultaneously, even when systems are claimed as highly redundant. b) Some said that the “01 second” gap between the two switches transitioning from RUN to CUTOFF, is too long a gap for it to be an electrical fault. The premise being that such a fault should affect both the switches nearly at the same time which I agree with. However, due to how FDR sampling works, Two faults just 1 millisecond apart can STILL be ‘logged’ as a whole 1 second apart. This puts electrical/systems failure back on the map. [Detailed explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianaviation/s/JYmuaZFoe5), supporting doc [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol3/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol3-part121-appM.pdf) ] e) I’ve heard that the fuel cutoff circuits are de-energized in the RUN position [Details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianaviation/s/u4Wc1WDMFI) ]. However, that doesn’t mean they’re immune to logic faults. A transient voltage spike or grounding issue could confuse a digital input into thinking a transition to cutoff had occurred even if no one touched the switch initially. f) This is not the first time the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s critical systems have thrown up red flags. There’s history and precedence- The MIT study [here](http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2023/2023-06-06-1010__John-Thomas__PUB.pdf) shows a previous incident where a TCMA related logic fault possibly ended up shutting down both engines during landing by mistake. The BBC report [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq7vgq2e5o.amp) goes even deeper, pointing to years of issues like faulty wiring, grounding problems, and other serious lapses. Together these seem to point to a pattern of deep rooted system vulnerabilities. Disclaimer: This post is a theory, not a statement of fact.

New details in the probe of last month’s Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit. A black-box recording of dialogue between the flight’s two pilots indicates it was the captain who turned off switches that controlled fuel flowing to the plane’s two engines, according to people familiar with U.S. officials’ early assessment of evidence uncovered in the crash investigation. The first officer who was flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner asked the more-experienced captain why he moved the switches to the “cutoff” position after it climbed off the runway, these people said. The first officer expressed surprise and then panicked, these people said, while the captain seemed to remain calm. A preliminary report of the probe released last week summarized the exchange but didn’t identify which pilot said what. The report, by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, said one pilot asked the other why he moved the switches, while the other denied doing so. Details in the preliminary report also suggest it was the captain who turned off the switches, according to people familiar with the matter, U.S. pilots and safety experts tracking the probe. The report didn’t say whether turning off the switches might have been accidental or deliberate. The new details could add to understanding the sequence of events that led to the June 12 tragedy, and the actions of the pilots, both of whom grew up with dreams of flying. The captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, was a decadeslong veteran, while the first officer, Clive Kunder, was in his early 30s and eager for the next stage of his career, friends and family members said. As the pilot actively flying, Kunder likely would have had his hands full pulling back on the Dreamliner’s controls at that stage of the flight, according to U.S. pilots who have read the Indian authorities’ report. Sabharwal, as the pilot monitoring, would have been more likely to have had his hands free as he oversaw the operation. The switches were moved in succession, one second apart, according to the report. About 10 seconds later, both switches were turned back on. The plane crashed near the Ahmedabad airport, killing all but one of the 242 on board. The preliminary details have fueled the belief among some U.S. officials that criminal authorities should review the matter, as would likely be the case if the crash had occurred on American soil, people familiar with the matter said. In the U.S., accident investigators historically have involved agencies such as the FBI if they believe a potential crime occurred, rather than a safety mishap. The Indian authorities’ preliminary report didn’t reach any conclusions about what led to the crash, or why the fuel switches were turned off. The report didn’t rule out possible design flaws, malfunctions or maintenance issues, and it noted the involvement of aviation medicine and psychology experts in the investigation. Campbell Wilson, chief executive of Air India, this week urged the airline’s staff to avoid drawing premature conclusions about the crash, and said that the investigation was “far from over.” An Air India representative said the airline continues to cooperate with the probe. When asked to comment on the Journal’s reporting about the pilots, a press officer for India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation and AAIB called it one-sided and declined to comment further. Aviation disasters that may involve potential deliberate actions to crash planes might never fully be resolved, due to incomplete evidence and disagreement over analyses. In some cases, countries taking part in lengthy international accident probes have disagreed with each other’s final conclusions. Plane-crash investigations can often last a year or longer, and new information that comes to light can contradict initial assessments. A soft-spoken veteran, and an energetic learner Sabharwal, the 56-year-old pilot who served as captain on the Air India flight, was a soft-spoken man devoted to caring for his ailing father, according to friends and neighbors. They said his father, who served as a bureaucrat in India’s civil aviation ministry, inspired his aviation career. Sabharwal started his flying career in the early 1990s, attending the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi. The prestigious flight school, run by India’s civil aviation ministry, has trained pilots for Air India and Indian Airlines. Kapil Kohal, an Air India pilot and friend of Sabharwal, overlapped with him for one year in flight school. Kohal said Sabharwal stood out among their classmates—very polite, never cursed, never drank alcohol, and spoke so softly that sometimes Kohal had to ask him to speak louder. “He was a very reserved guy right from the beginning,” Kohal said. Sabharwal’s serious demeanor, along with the way his eyes turned down at the corners, earned him the nickname “Sad Sack,” Kohal said. Unlike other students’ messy quarters, Sabharwal kept a spartan room filled with the bare minimum. “If you open his cupboard, there were two formal shirts, two T-shirts, two pairs of shoes, one slippers, and one bag,” Kohal said. He was driven by a sheer love of flying, Kohal said, and showed a flair for mentoring younger students. When Kohal was assigned to shadow Sabharwal on a flight, he explained flying concepts better than some instructors. He was “a middle class boy looking at the sky and saying, I want to be there,” Kohal said. The 32-year-old first officer, Kunder, had also dreamed of flying as a child, inspired by his mother’s three-decade career as an Air India flight attendant. His mother recalled his childhood travels with her to Singapore, Bangkok and Dubai. His sister, Camille Kunder, said that when they played make-believe as children, Kunder always pretended to be a pilot. “He just loved everything about flying,” she said. Kunder went to Florida at 19 to attend flight school, obtaining a U.S. commercial pilot license. Starting in 2014, he spent three years in India and Bahrain doing additional training and exams before Air India hired him in 2017. He began on the Airbus A320, before Air India in 2022 switched him to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Where some other pilots might have been frustrated over learning a new aircraft, Kunder was excited about flying a bigger jet, friends said. Family and friends described Kunder as a fan of superhero movies who taught himself how to build a PC from scratch, and in college nearly pursued a pro-esports career. His sister said he regularly sent her jokes and Instagram memes, and would call her to laugh about them. “His laugh is so contagious,” she said. Cockpit focus Contents of the flight’s cockpit voice recorders have been tightly held by Indian authorities and seen as key to helping fill out the sequence of events in the flight’s final moments. Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, has sought to listen to the recording herself, according to people familiar with the matter. An NTSB spokesman said that Homendy has been fully briefed on all aspects of the Air India investigation, including the cockpit voice recording and details from the flight data recorder. Homendy said her goal in working with Indian authorities was “to quickly determine whether the crash presented any immediate safety concerns to the traveling public.” Boeing, the engine maker GE Aerospace and the Federal Aviation Administration haven’t issued any safety bulletins or directives to 787 operators since the crash. The NTSB is supporting the Indian investigation because Boeing designed the Dreamliner and GE its engines, while the FAA certified the plane for passenger flight. The Indian authorities’ preliminary report finding that the fuel control switches were flipped in succession, one second apart, suggested a deliberate act, according to Ben Berman, a former senior NTSB official who helped oversee the U.S.-led investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 in 1999. Berman said that, prior to the engines’ fuel being cut, the report didn’t suggest anything out of the ordinary for what should have been a routine takeoff and climb-out. “There was nothing to prompt the crew to perform emergency procedures, become stressed, or do anything except rotate the nose up and retract the landing gear, like they had done so many times before,” Berman said.

In fact, just hours before take-off from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on June 12, a pilot flying the same aircraft from Delhi to Ahmedabad noted in the technical log a ‘Stabilizer Position Transducer Defect’, the official said. The Stabilizer Position Transducer is essentially a sensor that controls aircraft pitch — the up and down movement of the nose — and transmits the data in electrical signals to the flight control system to ensure that responses to pilot input are accurate. The official said the malfunction was checked and the engineer did the trouble shooting as per Boeing procedure. “The malfunction is a critical issue as it can trigger incorrect responses in flight control, including unintended fuel cut-off signal,” the official said. But he added, “The Stabilizer Position Transducer malfunction did not cause this crash, but the question is whether it led to multiple sensor failure.” A few weeks before, there were at least two more incidents, one of electrical snags in the aircraft that led to flight cancellation and another relating to false fuel system warning flashing on the screen of the aircraft.

SO, Just went back and re-read the preliminary reports of two recent aviation accidents in detail: * Air India Flight 171, crashed in Ahmedabad, India * American Airlines Flight 5342, Mid-air collision with Army Helicopter near Potomac River, USA And the **difference in reporting quality is shocking**. **Air India Flight 171:-** * Accident on 12th June, 2025 at BJ Medical College hostel, Ahmedabad, India. * [Preliminary Report](https://aaib.gov.in/What's%20New%20Assets/Preliminary%20Report%20VT-ANB.pdf) released on 12th July, 2025. 30 days after crash. Key issues with AAIB Preliminary Report 1. **Lacks critical timestamps and sequencing of events**. 2. **No mention of aircraft configuration, flap settings, or exact position** in feet/NM from the runway when the engines supposedly were cut off and other key moments. 3. **No CVR transcript** excerpts or technical details are provided beyond basic 3rd person narration. 4. The mistake made in **FADEC** abbreviation. 5. It **does not state the name and designation of investigators involved.** 6. **Prematurely clears Boeing of all the blame**, even before the final investigation is out or the proper investigation of engines and thrust column is completed. 7. Does not give any solid conclusion or directive. **The report leaves more questions than answers.** **American Airlines Flight 5342:-** * Accident on 29th Jan, 2025 near Washington National Airport, over Potomac River, USA. * [Preliminary Report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/DCA25MA108%20Prelim.pdf) released on March 11, 2025. 41 days after crash. NTSB report stands out because: 1. The NTSB’s preliminary report are incredibly detailed and thorough. It provided **accurate and timestamped communication** between ATC, Airplane and Helicopter. 2. Includes **Cockpit Callouts & Warnings** clearly. 3. **Provide better context** to the communication, but it also **mentioned the possible missed call and misunderstandings** between them. 4. The report also included the **precise aircraft configurations** such as flap settings, gear status, speeds, indicated vs actual altitudes, heading, rate of descent, and distance from the runway. 5. The report stated the **last action by the airplane pilot** was to pull up the nose before the crash (possibly when they saw the helicopter). It clearly mentions that elevators were deflected near their maximum nose up travel. 6. The report **clearly points to the misunderstanding and misidentification** by the Army Helicopter. 7. It **clearly mentions the names and designation of the investigators involved.** 8. NTSB concludes by issuing two urgent **safety recommendations** to the FAA concerning the **helicopter routes near DCA**. Finally, India’s AAIB report feels underwhelming, and incomplete. Not only does it avoid confronting the key technical aspects of the crash, but it also **creates new doubts** instead of resolving existing ones. The lack of transparency hurts the credibility of our aviation safety system as well as the effectiveness of bodies such as the AAIB. I feel AAIB should take a better stance and start with a detailed preliminary report, answering all the questions and doubts it created from the preliminary report.",137,94,0,https://reddit.com/r/indianaviation/comments/1m2f40t/the_stark_difference_between_indias_aaib_and_usas/,0.07,0.837,0.093,-0.7329,0.1111111111111111,0.25,0.05555555555555555,0.25,0.2222222222222222,0.1111111111111111,sadness

I am evaluating options, and I think this would be a great opportunity for me to experience another country during a layover. In particular, Singapore airlines is giving me the ability to layover in Singapore for over 12 hours at no additional cost. However, I am not sure what thoughts are on the extra vacation vs as fast as possible travel. I wanted to give some options I have with pros and cons, and get opinions on the best option: # Air India ($4800 USD) Pros: * Direct flight * Good new hard product (Delta) and decent food * Star Alliance Cons: * Extremely unreliable and often avoided by many (especially with Ahmedabad crash) * Most delayed airline of SFO * Risk of clogged toilets and infotainment / ports not working # Emirates ($4700 USD) Pros: * Reliable and solid hard product (A380) * Good food and service * Cheapest Cons: * Won't offer any new experiences since I have flown Emirates and have seen Dubai before * Slightly tight layover (2 hour 15 min Dubai) # Qatar Airways ($4900 USD) Pros: * A350 Q Suite is considered best business class * Good price in comparison to others * 3.5 hour layover in Doha may allow exploration of airport Cons: * Risk of getting ""Qatar'ed"" * Cannot book long layover in Doha unless I book multi-city trip (much more expensive) # Singapore Airlines ($5300 USD) Pros: * Excellent food and service * Ability to see Singapore for 12+ hours (even more if I want to) * Star Alliance Cons: * Most expensive * Singapore business has weird diagonal seating on A350 which may be uncomfortable Thoughts?

This is first. Secondly, regarding your question, and here is the most important point, I expect that such aircraft have an alarm system for such a reason as cutting off fuel to the engine during flight, and if it does not exist, this is a disaster. If it exists and does not activate or operate during the moment of fuel cut, this means that there is no electrical system that failed to issue an alarm, and a malfunction occurred in the system, which consequently prevented the issuance of the alarm in the cockpit. The malfunction may be a malfunction of one engine at the beginning and the other a little later. The turbofans then activate the RAT, which generated electricity for moments, enabling the distress call, which is a heroic act carried out by the pilots in my opinion. Here, it is necessary to focus and examine the timing and the time difference in milliseconds or seconds when exactly it was activated. These are the most important points that must be verified and their accuracy with the recordings, as the situation requires a quick reaction from the pilots to restore Starting the engines is like restarting the engines after confirming the malfunction that may have occurred during takeoff. In my opinion, the pilots are heroes in what they did in trying to regain control of the plane in these exceptional circumstances, trying hard for the safety of those in the plane and those on the ground. Do not stop searching no matter the cost. You are experts in a time when the rabble and those with interests have increased at the expense of productive and hard-working minds. Good luck to all of you, and the whole truth will appear with your presence. Excuse me if there are any spelling errors.
